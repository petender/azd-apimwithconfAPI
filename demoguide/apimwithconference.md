### Azure API Management with Conference demo API - demo scenario

<div style="background: lightgreen; 
            font-size: 14px; 
            color: black;
            padding: 5px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 5px;">

**Note:** Below demo steps should be used **as a guideline** for doing your own demos. Please consider contributing to add additional demo steps.
</div>

[comment]: <> (this is the section for the Tip: item; consider adding a Tip, or remove the section between <div> and </div> if there is no tip)

<div style="background: lightblue; 
            font-size: 14px; 
            color: black;
            padding: 5px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 5px;">

**Tip:** The scenario is based on the Microsoft Learn tutorial on Azure API Management using the Conference Demo API (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-and-publish), but it still allows adding your own custom API scenario to the deployed resource. 
</div>

<div style="background: lightgreen; 
            font-size: 14px; 
            color: black;
            padding: 5px; 
            border: 1px solid lightgray; 
            margin: 5px;">

**Note:** Before deleting the Resource Group and/or API Management Gateway, take note of the **API Management Resource name and region**, as this information is required to **purge** the Resource after deleting it. If the resource is not purged, **you cannot** redeploy the scenario.- For the purge process, see all the way at the end of the demoguide.

### 1. What Resources are getting deployed
This scenario deploys the sample **Conference Demo API** as a running **Azure API Management published API**. 

* MTTDemoDeployRGc%youralias%APIM - Azure Resource Group.
* %youralias%demoapim - Azure API Management Resource
* MTT Demo Conference API - published API, connecting to the sample https://conferenceapi.azurewebsites.net

<br></br>

### 2. What can I demo from this scenario after deployment
### API Management Published APIs

1. Navigate to the **deployed API Management Resource** blade. 
2. Show the **main information** related to the resource, by navigating through the **Overview** blade.
- Gateway URL: the URL listener from the API Management gateway; this would be the URL to use in your front-end application
- Virtual IP address: while not used for the service connectivity, it could be useful if the API Management Service is running behind a firewall
- Pricing Tier: API Management provides 4 different tiers (Developer, Standard, Premium, Consumption); the demo is deployed using **Standard**, as a single unit of scale
- APIs: we have 2 API endpoints published
- Subscriptions: there are 4 subscriptions offered by the gateway

3. Navigate to **APIs** and select **APIs**. This shows you 2 different published APIs, 
- Echo API: sample API which returns basic information when connecting to it.
- MTT Demo Conference API: simulates a published API with different API endpoints for pulling up Conference information such as speaker(s), session(s),... this is the main API to use in the demo scenarios below. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/published_APIs.png" alt="2 Published APIs for demos" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

4. Navigate to **MTT Demo Conference API**
5. From the **Design** tab, notice the different API operations available (GetSession(s), GetSpeaker(s), GetTopic(s))

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/API_operations.png" alt="API Operations" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

6. Navigate to the **Test** tab
7. Select the **GetSessions** API 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Sessions.png" alt="GetSessions API Operation" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

8. Press the **Send** button
9. Scroll down in the body section to HTTP Response, and show the **JSON** output from the Get Operation

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Sessions_HTTPResponse.png" alt="GetSessions API Operation HTTP Response" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

### API Management Inbound and Outbound Processing Policies
1. **Emphasize** some of the **Header** information that is getting exposed:
- x-aspnet-version
- x-powered-by

and hightlight this could be a security risk (you are telling what platform the API is running in the backend, which could be targeted for vulnerabilities now)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Sessions_Headers.png" alt="GetSessions API Operation Header" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

2. The **solution** for the security risk, is using **APIM Outbound Processing Policies**, which is configured for the **GetSpeakers** API. 

3. Navigate to the **GetSpeakers** API, and zoom in on the **Outbound Processing**. Notice the **set-header** policy items.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Speakers_Outbound.png" alt="GetSpeakers Outbound Processing" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

4. **Click** the **set-header** policy. This opens the XML-details of the Outbound Processing Policy for this API

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Speakers_Outbound_Policy.png" alt="GetSpeakers Outbound Processing Policy" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

5. Another common use case for API Gateways, is **limiting the number of requests** an API should/can handle. This can be managed using **Inbound Policies**. 

6. From the **GetSpeakers** API, zoom in on the **Inbound Processing** from the **Design** tab.
7. Notice the **rate-limit-by-key** policy setting. Click the **...** next to it. Select **Form-based Editor**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Speakers_Policy_formeditor.png" alt="GetSpeakers Inbound Processing Policy" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

8. This allows you to define Policy settings using the Graphical editor, instead of the XML syntax

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Speakers_Policy_formeditor_details.png" alt="GetSpeakers Inbound Processing Policy" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

9. To simulate the **rate limits**, navigate back to **GetSpeakers**, and select the **Test** tab; Press the **Send** button to retrieve the JSON response for this API.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Speakers_Response.png" alt="GetSpeakers JSON Response" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

10. **Repeat** this process by clicking the **Send** button more than 5 times within 20 seconds. this will result in a **Rate Limit Exceeded** Response

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Get_Speakers_TooManyRequests.png" alt="GetSpeakers Rate Limit Exceeded" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

11. After the time limit has passed, pressing **Send** again, will provide the expected JSON response with Speaker details.

### API Management Products and Subscriptions
1. Typically, you want to limit access to the API Management published APIs. This can be done using **Products** and **Subscriptions**. 

2. From the API Management Blade, navigate to **Products**. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Products.png" alt="API Management Products" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

3. Notice the **mtt_custom** Product currently only allows **Administrators** to use it. This is perfect for testing by your developers, before publicly exposing the actual API endpoints. 

4. Open the **mtt_custom** Product by clicking on its name. this opens the Product blade.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Products_details.png" alt="API Management Products details" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

5. Select **APIs**, which shows more details about which API is linked to this Product. 

6. Select **Subscriptions**, which shows the API Primary and Secondary key your developers would use in order to interact with this Product.  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Products_Subscriptions.png" alt="API Management Products Subscriptions details" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

### API Management Developer Portal
API Management provides a Developer Portal as part of the SKUs, which allows you to expose more information about the different APIs, as well as API Operations, consumers of your published APIs can use (Similar to Swagger if you are familiar with it).

1. From the **API Management Resource** Blade, navigate to **Developer Portal**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Developer_Portal.png" alt="API Management Developer Portal" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

2. This opens a **fully-customizable HTML Portal**, which can be extended with **Widgets, API Documentation, Access Permissions** and much more.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Developer_Portal_HomePage.png" alt="API Management Developer Portal" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

3. **Navigate** through the **Navigation** object, quickly describing what the different customization options are about (e.g. Layout, Styles,...)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Developer_Portal_Navigation.png" alt="API Management Developer Portal Navigation" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

4. **Navigate** to the **Upper Left Menu** of the Developer Portal, and select **API**, using **Ctrl- or the Apple Key** to open the **Hyperlink** (or navigate to **https://<Developer Portal URL>/apis**)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Developer_Portal_API.png" alt="API Management Developer Portal Published API" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

5. Select the **MTT Conference Demo API** Hyperlink, and open it by using the **Ctrl- or the Apple Key** (or navigate to **https://<Developer Portal URL>/api-details#api=demo-conference-api**)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petender/azd-apimwithconfAPI/refs/heads/main/demoguide/APIM/Developer_Portal_API_details.png" alt="API Management Developer Portal Published API" style="width:70%;">
<br></br>

This will allow developers/customers to find out which API Operations are available, what Request Parameters to use and what Response information to expect.

## Properly Deleting your API Management Gateway 

When you delete the Resource Group or the API Management Gateway Resource, it is only **soft-deleted**. This will block you from redeploying the same API Management Gateway. 

In order to succeed in a redeployment after soft-delete, a **purge** operation is required. this can be done using **Azure Cloud Shell**

1. Open **Azure Cloud Shell** and select **Bash**
2. Run the following Azure CLI command to **get a list of API Management resources in soft-delete state**:

```
az rest --method GET --url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<yoursubscriptionidhere>/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/deletedservices?api-version=2021-08-01
```
3. Take note of the location and API Management resource name, as you need it in the next command.

4. Run the following Azure CLI Command to **trigger the delete action**:

```
az rest --method delete --url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<yoursubscriptionidhere>/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/locations/eastus/deletedservices/petenderdemoapim?api-version=2021-08-01
```

You can now run the scenario deployment again.
